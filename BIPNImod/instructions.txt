Instructions for how to insert the modded files into the live version of EU4
IMPORTANT: Make sure you have a backup of EU4, either manually or through Steam
To insert the file, copy the file, go to the address and paste the file, and click the option to overwrite the current file.
00_basic_ideas.txt controls idea groups and has address Steam > steamapps > Europa Universalis IV > common > ideas
00_adm.txt, 00_dip.txt and 00_mil.txt are the files that control policies and together have address Steam > steamapps > Europa Universalis IV > common > policies
powers_and_ideas_1_english.yml and policies_l_english.yml are the cosmetic files that determine names and descriptions and have address Steam > steamapps > Europa Universalis IV > localisation
00_country_ideas.txt contains the altered ideas for England, Great Britain, Scotland, Ireland and Scandinavia and has address Steam > steamapps > Europa Universalis IV > common > ideas
The altered country ideas are of course optional, as you may wish to play with the usual idea sets for these nations.
